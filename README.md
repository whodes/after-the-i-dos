My best friend wanted an audio guest book, but didn't want to pay the high price.

I told her I could set one up for free and here we are! ðŸŽ‰

This is an API that allows guests to call and leave voicemails.


# ðŸš€ Features
- Accepts incoming calls via Twilio
- Plays a pre-recorded message before allowing guests to leave a voicemail
- Saves voicemail recordings to a database
- Provides an API to manage & retrieve recorded messages

# Stack 
- Python 3.8+
- Flask (API framework)
- Twilio (for handling phone calls)
- SQLite / SQLAlchemy (for storing messages)
- Flask-Migrate (database migrations)
- Gunicorn (for production deployment)
